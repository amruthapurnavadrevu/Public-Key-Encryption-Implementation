# Public Key Encryption Implementation

This project introduces an alternative method of public-key encryption, providing a novel approach to securing communication over computer networks. The encryption scheme employs a unique set of parameters for both encryption and decryption, offering potential advantages in security, efficiency, and flexibility.

## Approach 

- Public and Private Keys: The encryption process revolves around a public key composed of a list of integers denoted as 'h', while the private key consists of three integers: 'e', 'q', and 'w'. These keys form the basis for encrypting and decrypting messages.

- Message Encryption: To encrypt a message, it is first converted into a sequence of bits. These bits are then segmented into blocks of a predetermined size, typically matching the length of the 'h' list. Each block is then encrypted by performing component-wise multiplication with the corresponding elements of the public key 'h'.

- Ciphertext Transmission: The resulting encrypted blocks are then transmitted across the network to the intended receiver. This transmission ensures that the original message remains confidential and secure from unauthorized access.

- Ciphertext Decryption: Upon receiving the ciphertext, the receiver initiates the decryption process. This involves computing the inverse of a specific parameter 'w' modulo another parameter 'q'. This inverse is then used to reverse the encryption process, recovering the original plaintext blocks from the ciphertext.

- Message Reconstruction: Once the ciphertext blocks are decrypted, they are converted back into a sequence of bits, which are then reconstructed to form the original plaintext message. This final step completes the decryption process, enabling the receiver to access the intended information.

## Benefits 

- Enhanced Security: The alternative encryption method provides an additional layer of security for transmitting sensitive information over networks. By leveraging unique parameters and encryption techniques, it mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

- Efficiency: The method offers efficiency advantages compared to traditional encryption algorithms. This efficiency is crucial for optimizing network performance and resource utilization.

- Flexibility and Customization: The customizable parameters of the encryption scheme allow for tailored encryption solutions, catering to specific security requirements and operational constraints. This flexibility ensures adaptability across diverse computing environments.

- Innovation and Research: By exploring alternative encryption methods, the project contributes to ongoing research and innovation in computer network security. It fosters the development of new techniques and algorithms, driving advancements in the field.

## Conclusion

In summary, the project presents an innovative approach to public-key encryption, offering unique features and potential benefits in security, efficiency, flexibility, and innovation.
